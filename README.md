Projects written in "R" programming language, using RStudio IDE:

* [BF/CM Visualizations Weekly](/acme/weekly) - Wrote "R" script to visualize historic e-commerce traffic over the week of Black Friday to Cyber Monday, to determine load handling expectations.

First, the script "acme_BF_YTD.R" produces bar charts showing number of orders placed for the week, over the past few years years.

Secondly, the script uses ggplot2 to produce a line chart comparing 5 years of activity. (name was changed to ACME for confidentiality)

* [BF/CM Visualizations Hourly](/acme/hourly) - Wrote "R" script to visualize numbers of order per day over the week of Black Friday to Cyber Monday, in order to determine load handling expectations.
